# CLAUDE.md — NotifyByWebApp

Very lightweight PWA ("Notify by Web Application"): users install it to the Home Screen of
modern Android/iOS phones and receive **push notifications** for **message channels** they
subscribed to. Channels are created by anyone; a channel is identified by a **long, secure,
non-guessable code** (shareable as QR code). Anyone holding the code can **send** messages to
the channel's subscribers — via a small web interface or via a plain **HTTP API** usable
from any third-party service. No accounts, no logins.

**Disclaimer:** Hobby project, no warranty, may stop working anytime. Public repo:
https://github.com/mghomedev/NotifyByWebApp

## Core model

- **Channel** = secret code (bearer capability), `secrets.token_urlsafe(24)` → 32 chars,
  192 bits. Format-checked everywhere: `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{16,64}$`.
- The server stores only `sha256(code)` ("kh") — never the raw code → a storage leak does
  not leak send capability. Codes travel only in POST bodies (never URLs → never in
  platform request logs) and in the app URL **fragment** (never sent to servers).
- Possession of the code ⇒ may subscribe AND send (deliberate; a separate subscribe-only
  key remains a possible future option).
- **Subscriber** = Web Push subscription (endpoint + p256dh/auth keys), stored per channel
  keyed by `sha256(endpoint)`. One push subscription per install; server maps
  channel → endpoints.
- **Message** = optional title (≤120) + optional body (≤2000) + optional http(s) url
  (≤500). At least one of title/body is required; a missing title is derived from the
  body's first line (first `TITLE_SNIPPET`=60 chars + "…"). Stored per channel (newest
  first, capped at `NBW_MAX_MESSAGES`=50) and pushed to all subscribers.
  The full title+body is always stored, but **every display surface de-duplicates**: the
  in-app message list, the new-message toast, and the browser push notification render the
  body only when it differs from the title — so a body-only short message (whose derived
  title equals the body) shows once, never "Hi / Hi". (Dedup is at the display layer, in JS;
  the server derivation is unchanged.)
- **Send-password (optional)**: a channel may set a send-password at creation; only its
  `sha256` hash is stored in the channel meta (`send_pw`) — never the raw phrase. When set,
  publishing requires the matching password (constant-time compare → `SendForbidden`/403
  otherwise); subscribing and receiving stay open to anyone holding the code. Channel
  snapshots expose `send_protected` so the send UIs show a password field only when needed.
  `/api/channel` accepts `send_password` (min 4, max 128); `/api/message` accepts it too.
- **Deleting messages**: `/api/message/delete` (one, by message `id`) and
  `/api/messages/clear` (all, or all-but-newest via optional `keep`) — gated by the same
  send-password when the channel is protected (`_require_send_password`, shared with
  publish). App page: a trash icon per message, a clear-all trash in the message header,
  and — when a channel has >3 messages — the 4th-and-older go into a collapsed
  "More … (N older)" expander with its own single "delete older" trash (`keep=3`, Redis
  `LTRIM`). On a protected channel the UI reuses the send-password field or prompts for it.

## Install-URL trick (core UX idea — the app URL carries the channel codes)

The URL used to install the Home Screen app **contains the channel code(s)**:
`/a#codes=CODE1,CODE2`. The landing page `/` is the generator. **Returning visitors**
whose channels are already saved on this device are routed straight to the app — a `<head>`
redirect on `/` (`location.replace('/a#codes=…')`, built from the saved store) so the main
page STARTS with their channels + messages + send, not the create form. The redirect is
**skipped** on `?create` (the escape hatch every in-app "start page" link uses), when saving
is opted out (`nbw_nosave`), or when the saved set is empty / all-tombstoned; `/a` never
redirects back, so there is no loop. On `/a` the channels list (`#channels`) is rendered
**above** the notifications card so saved channels are the first thing shown. The generator
is ordered **end-user-first** (top→down = less→more technical): (1) create your channel → shows the
code + QR + app link together, plus a **visible** "Your channels" list (`#your-channels`
+ `#code-list`, shown whenever there are codes — must NOT be hidden in an expander) and a
collapsible "Add an existing channel code"; (2) send a message; the auto-save card; the
supported-devices list; then a smaller,
clearly-labelled **"Further technical information for developers"** section (the HTTP API)
last. Both pages also carry a shared no-warranty / free-open-source **disclaimer**
(English + German) and the **compatibility list**. Implementation layers (in notify_pages.py):

1. Codes live in the **URL fragment** — never sent to any server.
2. `/a` injects a **data:-URI web app manifest** (client-side, absolute URLs, `start_url`
   includes the fragment, `id` = hash of the code set so different code sets are distinct
   installs). There is deliberately **no static manifest** — it would override the install
   URL with a code-less `start_url`. CSP includes `manifest-src 'self' data:`.
3. Codes are mirrored to **localStorage** (`nbw_codes`); removed channels are remembered
   in `nbw_removed` (a tombstone set **shared by both pages** — the generator writes it on
   Remove and clears it on any explicit add, `/a` likewise) so a stale saved store or
   install-URL fragment does not resurrect a removed channel on either page. `/a`'s
   `loadCodes()` builds its active set as the **union** of the shared saved store
   (`readSavedStore()`), this page's legacy `nbw_codes` list, and the fragment, then subtracts
   `nbw_removed` — so a channel that lives in only one store (e.g. one pasted in-app before the
   stores were unified) is never dropped, and a removed one is never resurrected.
4. Final fallback (matters on iOS, where the installed app has separate storage): in-app
   “Add a channel” by pasting a code.
5. Per-device **mute** (`nbw_muted`): each channel card has a 🔔/🔕 Mute toggle. Muting
   unsubscribes this device's endpoint from that channel on the server (`/api/unsubscribe`)
   rather than dropping pushes in the SW (which would violate the Web Push contract).
   `ensureSubscribed` and the SW `pushsubscriptionchange` re-subscribe only non-muted codes.

## Channel-persistence durability requirement (do NOT regress)

Users trust that saved channels persist locally; losing that state loses their channels
(the only recovery is the channel code / app-link QR). Requirements:

- The landing-page saved-channels feature is **AUTO-SAVE by default** (no opt-in — opt-in
  was too easy to miss, so users lost channels). Any create/add/remove persists to **BOTH**
  a cookie (`nbw_codes`) **and** localStorage (`nbw_saved_codes`, a key distinct from the app
  page's `nbw_codes` so it never clobbers the installed app's list). It **reads/merges from
  both** on load and **re-writes both on every visit** — self-heals (a dropped store is
  restored) and refreshes the cookie window. A clear status ("✅ N channels saved on this
  device") plus a create-time confirmation shows it. Users opt OUT via **Forget & stop
  saving** (clears both + sets `nbw_nosave`); a **Save my channels here** button re-enables.
- This **cookie `nbw_codes` + localStorage `nbw_saved_codes`** pair is now the **shared store
  read/written by BOTH pages**. `/a` reads it (`readSavedStore()`) as one source of its
  `loadCodes()` union and **mirrors** the current channel set back to it on every
  load/add/remove (`mirrorSavedStore()`), honouring the same `nbw_nosave` opt-out — so a
  channel created/added/removed on either page converges on the other, and the `/` →
  `/a` returning-visitor redirect reads it. (The `nbw_codes` **cookie** rides in request
  headers, but that is not a new leak: every `/api` POST already carries the raw code in its
  body — the code is a bearer capability the server needs — and the guarded invariant is
  codes-never-in-**URLs**/logs, not codes-never-in-cookies.)
- **Never** rename, clear, or change the FORMAT of these keys without a migration that
  preserves existing data; never clear them implicitly; keep this code stable across
  releases. Treat it as load-bearing user data.
- Removal is **user-initiated only**: the per-channel **Remove** button, **Forget saved
  channels**, or the user clearing their browser cookies/site data.
- Fragility to design around (why localStorage was added alongside the cookie): browsers cap
  JS-set (`document.cookie`) cookies — Safari ITP limits them to ~7 days regardless of the
  1-year expiry — so localStorage is the durable copy and the cookie is secondary. The
  channel code + QR remain the true backup.

## Architecture (all UI served inline from one function — no static bundling risk)

- `api/index.py` — single Vercel entrypoint (`BaseHTTPRequestHandler` named `handler`;
  `pyproject.toml` `[tool.vercel] entrypoint = "api.index:handler"`).
  GET: `/` `/a` `/sw.js` `/vendor/qrcode.js` `/icon.svg` `/icon-192.png` `/icon-512.png`
  `/apple-touch-icon.png` (+ `-precomposed` alias) `/favicon.ico` `/robots.txt`
  `/google<token>.html` (Search
  Console verification) `/api/health` `/api/status`.
  POST (JSON, code in body): `/api/channel` `/api/subscribe` `/api/unsubscribe`
  `/api/message` `/api/message/delete` (by `id`) `/api/messages` `/api/messages/clear`.
  OPTIONS: CORS preflight for `/api/*`.
- `notify_core.py` — codes/hashing, validation, rate limiter, storage backends, push.
- `notify_pages.py` — landing + app HTML/JS, service worker, CSP, icon SVG, robots.
- `notify_icons.py` / `notify_vendor.py` — base64-embedded PNGs / vendored
  qrcode-generator 1.4.4 (MIT, served from `/vendor/qrcode.js`; no CDN → CSP stays
  `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`).
- `scripts/` — VAPID key generation, icon regeneration (`make_icons.ps1` + `embed_icons.py`).

## Storage (decided: Upstash Redis via REST; in-memory fallback)

- `RedisStorage`: Upstash REST `/pipeline` endpoint, Bearer token, JSON command arrays.
  Env: `KV_REST_API_URL`/`KV_REST_API_TOKEN` (Vercel Marketplace “Upstash for Redis”) or
  `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`/`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`.
  Keys: `nbw:meta:{kh}` (JSON string, `SET NX EX`), `nbw:subs:{kh}` (hash eh→sub JSON),
  `nbw:msgs:{kh}` (list, `LPUSH`+`LTRIM`). All keys get TTL `NBW_CHANNEL_TTL_DAYS`=400,
  refreshed on activity → dead channels expire by themselves.
- `MemoryStorage`: used automatically when no Redis env is set (tests/local dev; on
  Vercel it would be per-instance only — configure Redis for real deployments).

## Web Push facts (verified against implementation; do NOT re-derive)

- VAPID keys as raw URL-safe base64 (32-byte private scalar / 65-byte uncompressed public
  point) — `scripts/generate_vapid_keys.py`. pywebpush accepts the raw private string;
  the public key is embedded into `/a` and converted client-side (urlB64ToU8).
- `webpush(...)` per subscriber in a ThreadPoolExecutor (≤8 workers), `ttl=86400`,
  timeout 10s, on a `requests.Session` with `max_redirects=0` (never follow a redirect
  off the push service); `WebPushException` 404/410 → subscription pruned, other statuses
  → `failed` (NOT pruned — a 5xx/401 is transient/misconfig, not a dead endpoint).
- **Payload is byte-bounded, not char-bounded**: services hard-cap the encrypted body at
  4096 bytes. `publish()` serializes the push JSON with `ensure_ascii=False` and truncates
  the pushed title/body/channel by UTF-8 bytes (`PUSH_*_MAX_BYTES`); the FULL text is still
  stored for the in-app message list. (A 2000-char CJK body would otherwise be ~12 KB and
  every push would 413 — regression-tested in `test_push_e2e`.)
- Without `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` the message is stored, push skipped,
  `push_disabled: true` returned (local dev works without keys).
- `publish()` stores the message first; a storage error AFTER the store (touch/get_subs) is
  swallowed (returns `push_error`) so a retry can’t duplicate the message.
- **Compatibility list + too-old warning** (`COMPAT_HTML` on both pages via `__COMPAT__`;
  `pushStatus()`/`applyCompat()` on `/a`). Verified minimums (2026): iPhone iOS **16.4**+
  (installed), iPad iPadOS **16.4**+ (installed), Mac Safari **16.1**+ on macOS 13 Ventura+
  (or Chrome/Firefox/Edge), Android any modern browser (Android **10**+ floor), desktop
  Chrome **52**+/Firefox **44**+/Edge **17**+/Opera **42**+. Detection: feature-detection
  (`pushSupported`) is authoritative; UA parsing only picks the warning wording — iPhone
  version from `CPU iPhone OS (\d+)_(\d+)` (iOS 26+ freezes this token, so only trust
  `>=16.4` as "new enough"), iPad version is unreadable (reports as Mac → `maxTouchPoints`),
  Android version informational. `#too-old` amber banner warns on iPhone<16.4 / iPad-too-old
  / unsupported Android/desktop browser; a too-new-but-not-installed iPhone gets the install
  hint instead.
- **iOS**: Web Push only for Home-Screen-installed PWAs since iOS 16.4; `Notification`/
  `PushManager` absent in the Safari tab → the app shows install instructions
  (`isIOS() && !isStandalone()`, enable button hidden); permission request must come from a
  user gesture (the “Enable notifications” button). `ensureSubscribed` reports ON only when
  the server accepted ≥1 channel (never a false ON on 404/409/502) — regression-tested.
- **VAPID key rotation**: the client compares `subscription.options.applicationServerKey`
  with the current key and re-subscribes on mismatch.
- SW (`/sw.js`, `Service-Worker-Allowed: /`, no-cache): push → `showNotification` inside
  `waitUntil` AND `postMessage({type:'nbw-refresh'})` to open tabs (instant in-app refresh);
  `notificationclick` → prefer an existing `/a` client, else open, cross-origin
  message links open in a new window (don’t destroy the app tab); `pushsubscriptionchange`
  → re-subscribe + re-POST `/api/subscribe` for the codes mirrored into a Cache entry
  (`/__nbw_state`, SWs can’t read localStorage); tiny app-shell cache network-first.
- **Live app-page updates (works with notifications OFF — required)**: `/a` polls every
  channel via `/api/messages` every `POLL_MS`=12s while the tab is visible (guarded by
  `visibilitychange`; overridable in tests via `window.__NBW_POLL_MS`), plus an instant
  refresh on the SW `nbw-refresh` message. `refreshChannel(code, silent)` only rebuilds the
  DOM when the message set actually changed (`data-msgsig`), so no flicker / no collapsing
  the “More” expander. A genuinely NEW arrival (not the first baseline, not the user’s own
  send/delete which pass `silent`, not muted channels) shows an in-app **toast** (“New
  message in <channel>: title / body”) with **Go to channel / Reply / Delete** actions, and
  **highlights** that message (`.msg-new` + NEW badge) — at most one highlight per channel
  (`data-newid`, the newest arrival).

## Security & operations requirements

- **No secrets in the repo — ever** (public GitHub!). Secrets: `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`
  (+public/subject), Redis URL/token — only in `.env` (gitignored) / Vercel env vars.
  `.env.example` documents names without values.
- All user content rendered with `textContent` (never innerHTML with untrusted data);
  message urls must be http(s) and are length-capped; control chars (C0/C1/DEL, via
  `unicodedata` category `Cc`) stripped server-side from titles/bodies/names; a
  control-char-only title is rejected (cleaned before the required-check).
- **SSRF guard**: `validate_subscription` rejects endpoints whose host is loopback,
  private, link-local, reserved/metadata (169.254.x), multicast or `localhost` — the push
  endpoint is a URL the server will POST to. (Combined with `max_redirects=0`. DNS-rebind
  to internal is a documented residual for a hobby app.) Tested in `test_core.py`.
- Security headers on every response: `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`,
  `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS, guards custom domains); HTML additionally gets the CSP
  from `notify_pages.CSP` (default-src 'none' + minimum grants; specific directives asserted
  in `test_csp_grants_exactly_what_the_pages_need`).
- `handler.log_message` is overridden to be silent — NEVER remove
  (test: `test_no_request_logging`). Don't log codes, endpoints, or request lines.
  Catch-all handlers use `_safe_error` (no second response after a failed write → no
  double-fault tracebacks); client-disconnect errors are swallowed.
- Client IP for rate limiting = `x-real-ip` (set by Vercel, not client-spoofable) then
  leftmost `x-forwarded-for` then socket. Rate limit per IP (`NBW_RATE_PER_MIN`=120/min,
  best effort per instance) on all `/api` POSTs → 429; plus a per-instance channel-creation
  soft cap (`NBW_MAX_CHANNELS_PER_MIN`=60) so header-spoofing can’t drive unbounded channel
  creation. Vercel Firewall is the hard backstop. The `RateLimiter` prunes on an interval
  and is deterministically size-bounded (no O(N) rebuild per request).
- Early error responses (413/429/404/400) **drain the request body** first so the socket
  isn’t reset with unread data (client would otherwise see a connection reset, not the
  error). Handler sets `timeout=20` so a short/slow body can’t park a thread forever.
- Caps: body ≤64KB (413), subscribers/channel `NBW_MAX_SUBS_PER_CHANNEL`=200 (409, enforced
  write-then-verify so concurrent subscribes can’t overshoot), messages kept 50.
  `Server:` header reveals no Python version.
- CORS `*` on `/api` (the code IS the auth; enables third-party browser senders); the
  hand-built 429 responses also carry CORS.
- `GET /api/status` = **secret-gated** diagnostics (`NBW_STATUS_SECRET` via
  `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` header or `?key=<secret>`, constant-time compare):
  reports push-configured?, storage backend + live ping reachability, deployed
  commit/env/region (from `VERCEL_*`), and config limits. Returns NO secret values.
  Fails closed: 404 when the secret env var is unset, 401 on a wrong/missing secret.
  Lets the deployment be health-checked black-box (`core.diagnostics()`).

## Tests (pytest; must be green before every deploy) — 186 tests

- `tests/test_core.py` — unit: codes, validation, SSRF host guard, control-char cleaning,
  limiter (deterministic clock + bounded size), config parsing, both storage backends
  (RedisStorage against captured command pipelines), UTF-8 truncation.
- `tests/test_api.py` — integration: the real handler on a local port, in-memory storage,
  monkeypatched `webpush` capture; happy path + error/cap/prune/rate-limit + channel-create
  soft cap + oversized-body drain + CSP directive + StorageError→502 + security headers +
  the no-logging guarantee.
- `tests/test_storage_http.py` — the real `RedisStorage` HTTP layer against a fake Upstash
  REST server (request shape, Bearer auth, `/pipeline`, per-command error, non-JSON, refused
  connection → `StorageError`).
- `tests/test_push_e2e.py` + `tests/pushkit.py` — **real-crypto Web Push**: a mock push
  service captures the actual `pywebpush` request; a `FakeDevice` (real P-256 keys)
  DECRYPTS the aes128gcm payload and verifies the VAPID JWT signature. Proves encryption,
  VAPID, fan-out, 410-pruning, 5xx=failed, and byte-bounding of long unicode.
- `tests/test_ui_playwright.py` — headless Chromium: landing create→code→QR/link flow with
  a VISIBLE "Your channels" list, developer section, **auto-save** persistence + survival of
  cookie- or localStorage-loss + Forget/re-enable, app page from fragment, manifest
  injection, shareable labelled QR, message order + local timestamps, channel sorting by
  latest activity, message delete + clear-all + "More" expander, send-password UI, the
  **live auto-refresh → in-app toast (Go/Reply/Delete) + one-per-channel highlight**, and the
  **`/` → `/a` returning-visitor redirect** (with `/?create` escape hatch + `nbw_nosave`
  suppression), the **shared-store union** (a channel in only the legacy list OR only the
  cross-page store still renders on `/a`), the **shared tombstone** (a channel removed on
  the generator is not resurrected on `/a` by a stale fragment), and the **title/body
  display de-dup** (a body-only message renders once in the list + toast, never "Hi / Hi").
- `tests/test_ui_notifications.py` + `tests/uikit.py` — **HEADED** Chromium (headless denies
  notification permission): delivers a real push into the SW via CDP
  `ServiceWorker.deliverPushMessage` and asserts the displayed notification’s
  title/body/tag/click-url (incl. the title==body de-dup → empty notification body);
  incl. a Pixel device-emulation run (Android = Chrome).
- `tests/test_ui_platforms.py` — iOS Safari-tab emulation (Push APIs stripped → install
  banner, enable hidden), iOS installed-standalone emulation (fake push stack → subscribe
  registers on the server, UI ON), and the false-ON regression guard (server 404 → error
  state, not ON).
- Playwright suites auto-skip without Chromium/display: `python -m playwright install
  chromium`. The headed notification tests open a browser window; skip with
  `-k "not (notifications)"` if running unattended.
- Local python is 3.10, Vercel 3.12 — keep code compatible with both.
